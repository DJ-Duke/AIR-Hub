Khan Academy founder Ted: Envisioning education in the AI era, students have AI tutors, and teachers have AI teaching assistants.



Khan Academy proposed an AI named `Khanmigo`, which can teach students, answer their questions, but not show the answers or cheat for them.

It is shown that GPT is actually quite good at reasoning and doing (simple) math problems.

(GPT) is able to ==divine what is probably the misconception in the student's mind==.

It is mind-blowing that the AI can understand the video that the student is watching, and answers high-leveled questions such as "Why I should care about this video."

The AI can role-play character in books, such as "The Great Gatsby", to answer the students' question about the motivation of their actions.

The AI can be used to provide feedbacks to essay writing. For example, it can clearly show you whether your arguments are supported by your materials. And it will point out where improvement could be done.

Khan has done a lot of works to achieve this. Such as spending 6 months prompt engineering for tutoring with an emphasis on math and fine-tuning the model for their special use case.

One important idea from OpenAI researchers: *We could dramatically improve the GPT's ability in math and its ability in tutoring if we allow the AI to think before it speaks*

This, acutally, is in accordance with **prolonged logic chain** that [Geoffrey Hinton](../Google/Interview--Geoffrey Hinton.md) hinted.

Khan: Perhaps the most poetic use case is AI can be used to enhance HI, human intelligence, human potential and human purpose.
