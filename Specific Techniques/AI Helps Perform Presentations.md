## `ST_PP_004` GPT+Midjourney: How to teach GPT4 to write promots for Midjourney V5

[MidJourney V5 + GPT 4 王炸组合，让摄影师无路可逃_哔哩哔哩_bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1cb411Z7HA/?spm_id_from=autoNext&vd_source=57ac3ae5415445af2ffe1e61e1722d73)

Above is an impressive tutorial!

Should learn it through!

The streamer copy the technical explanation of Midjourney and ask GPT4 to learn it before letting the GPT4 to create any prompt. 

Duke thinks this step is insightful.

Besides, the streamer also use example to teach the GPT4 into writting proper prompt.

This follows the principle of prompt writing advocated by Andrew Ng

This project is really good! It use an uploaded picture as a reference.

What it does it using the reference as the condition of the attention mechanism.

By this means, it can generate new picture with consistent style and character.

It can even generate style-consistent 3D-style picture given a comic style picture as reference!
