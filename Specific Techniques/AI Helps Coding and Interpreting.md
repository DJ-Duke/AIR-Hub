## `ST_CI_001` Github Copilot X Chat: ask Chatgpt to write code and interpret any codes

[Github Copilot X Chat 模式体验，更自然更强大！_哔哩哔哩_bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UV4y1S7Gi/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=57ac3ae5415445af2ffe1e61e1722d73)

Copilot X Chat just moves beyond auto-completition which is not a easy tool to use.

Instead, this time you can ask the Chatgpt to write a code with a specific function by just intructing it by natural language.

Besides, you can also ask it to explain whatever you do not understand.

One of the most useful function is to auto write test program for a function. This surely saves a lot of time to construct test functions to check for potential bugs.

Moreover, it also works as an agent for VS Code, you can ask question like "how to close the right-hand side minimap?" and it will inform you the way. (Even directly provide you a button!)

The author also explains his view of the difference between the previous version of the Copliot in the current version. [See Link](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UV4y1S7Gi?t=336.1)

To be honest, Duke has not got access to the plugin of GPT4 yet.
But he thinks it will be very useful for data visualization.

But based on this [How do I access plugins? | OpenAI Help Center](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7183286-how-do-i-access-plugins)
> How can I get access to plugins?
> If you are a ChatGPT Plus user, you should be able to use plugins. We started granting access on May 12th, 2023 and we plan to gradually roll it out to 100% of Plus users within a week (thanks for your patience!).
Duke thinks he will soon able to try it out!
