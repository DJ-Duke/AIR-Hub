## `ST_CI_001` Github Copilot X Chat: ask Chatgpt to write code and interpret any codes

[Github Copilot X Chat 模式体验，更自然更强大！_哔哩哔哩_bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UV4y1S7Gi/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=57ac3ae5415445af2ffe1e61e1722d73)

Copilot X Chat just moves beyond auto-completition which is not a easy tool to use.

Instead, this time you can ask the Chatgpt to write a code with a specific function by just intructing it by natural language.

Besides, you can also ask it to explain whatever you do not understand.

One of the most useful function is to auto write test program for a function. This surely saves a lot of time to construct test functions to check for potential bugs.

Moreover, it also works as an agent for VS Code, you can ask question like "how to close the right-hand side minimap?" and it will inform you the way. (Even directly provide you a button!)
