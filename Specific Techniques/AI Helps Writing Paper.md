This video tells you how to properly prompt GPT4 into help you write a thesis.

Steps are:

- First, let GPT4 choose a research subject, ask for 5 options
  - Tell explicitly that you are in what major, want to select a subject for a thesis for what purpose (e.g. obtaining a Bachlor Degree)
- Secondly, let GPT4 generates an abstract for a certain option that you selected.
- Thirdly, let GPT4 constructs an outline
  - You can also let GPT4 produce multiple outlines for you to select.
- Finally, let GPT4 write content for each of the subsection in the outline. Ask one at a time.
  - Should specify some constraints, e.g., the total number of words is 15,000, and let the GPT4 to generate contents with a length in a proper proportion. 
- Notice that do not let GPT4 to provide any reference. Because GPT4 cannot access to references and  generally it will fake one. Instead, you can ask for NewBing to provide some reference based on the contents.
- Another important notice is that you cannot directly use the creation of GPT4 to submit. It is only of reference value. If you would do so, there are always some AI plagiarism judgment tools to find out. Besides, GPT4 isn't always right. Youself has the full responsibility to check its production and make sure it is right.
