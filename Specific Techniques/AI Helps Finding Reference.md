## `ST_FR_001` Consensus: Evidence-Based Answers, Faster

[Consensus - Evidence-Based Answers, Faster](https://consensus.app/)

Consensus is a search engine that uses AI to extract and distill findings directly from scientific research, in order to answer your academic questions.

### Duke's Initial Trial:

[What are the state-of-the-art methods to perform prediction tasks for irregularly sampled time series?](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20are%20the%20state-of-the-art%20methods%20to%20perform%20prediction%20tasks%20for%20irregularly%20sampled%20time%20series%3F&synthesize=on&year_min=2020)

Jingzhi: Useable, but not very reliable. Many important works are missing. Could be used as the first-search for literature.

## `ST_FR_002` Elicit: The AI Research Assistant

[Elicit: The AI Research Assistant](https://elicit.org/)

Elicit can find relevant papers without perfect keyword match, summarize takeaways from the paper specific to your question, and extract key information from the papers.

### Duke's Initial Trial:

Qustion: What are the state-of-the-art methods to perform prediction tasks for irregularly sampled time series?

Jingzhi: Compared to Consensus, it has an advanced Filter to select keywords and study types. The results it got are more comprehensive. More important and relevant works are provided. I'd say it is very helpful.
