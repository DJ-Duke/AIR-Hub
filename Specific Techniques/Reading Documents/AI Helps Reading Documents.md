### Duke's Initial Trial:

I let it reads "Contactless Seismocardiography via Deep Learning Radars" by Unsoo Ha et al.

I asked "What '4D' indicates in '4D Cardiac Beamformer'?"

I'd reckon its feedback is not very satisfactory. One have to read the paper him/herself to get the hint of such a subtle concept.

But it will show you which part of the paper its answers are derived from, this is handy when you asking not so hard a question. Save your time to look for the question-related part yourself.
