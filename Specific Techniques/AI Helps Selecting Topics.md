## `ST_ST_001`: How to prompt AI to porvide research direction and topic

[任何人不会GPT找论文创新点我都会伤心ok?_哔哩哔哩_bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1mV4y1R7q5/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&vd_source=57ac3ae5415445af2ffe1e61e1722d73)

In this video, the author give an example to prompt GPT to provide useful research directions.

It is done by first let the GPT say the current boundary of current research, and then let it reason how to extend it a little further by things like cross-subject technologies, hotspot and trend, practical application scenarios.

**Consequently**, the GPT can indeed find some research direction with certain levels of novelity, just like us human usually do to conduct research.

It is interesting to see that human generally find novel research direction following the same logic.

So AI with logic can do the same things, not very surprising.
